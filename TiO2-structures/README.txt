Those phases of TiO2 that have already been reported in the literature have standard names. 
They have been equilibrated at 0GPa.

fluorite
hollandite
OIanalogue & OIphase (*)

ramsdellite & ramsdelliteAnalogue (*)
rutile
TiO2B

(*): There are two phases that, for the MA potential, are slightly different from the ones reported in experiment: the OI phase and the ramsdellite phase. The appropriate data are provided for both; files ending in 'analogue' refer to the phases appropriate to the MA potential and are expected to be the only ones actually observed, but the experimental ones are provided for reference.
(**): The Pca21 phase is not stable with the MA potential and is provided for reference only.



The novel phases obtained from the RSS approach follow a standard naming convention,
        newphase-PRESSURE-letter-SPACEGROUP,
where
- 'PRESSURE' is one of 0GPa, 40GPa or 60GPa
- 'letter' increases from a according to the potential energy of the reference structure (but only 'unique' structures are given labels, i.e. there are intervening structures obtained from other pressures that are not included even if they appeared in the AIRSS output for the pressure listed)
- SPACEGROUP gives a rough label of the space group, generally ignoring minuses
