# TiO2_random_search_pattern_recognition
Supplementary materials for "Predicting the phase diagram of titanium dioxide with random search and pattern recognition"

* TiO2-structures: the structures of TiO2 found in random searches. They have been equilibrated at 0GPa. Those phases of TiO2 that have already been reported in the literature have standard names. The novel phases obtained from the RSS approach follow a standard naming convention, newphase-PRESSURE-letter-SPACEGROUP. More information can be found in README.txt.

* DFT-inputs: LDA, PBE, and PBEsol DFT input files for CASTEP.

* TiO2-free-energies.tar.gz: a zip file that contains all the neccesary LAMMPS inputs for performing free energy calculations.

* Notebook: a Python notebook for generating descriptors, performing dimensionality reduction, and clustering.
